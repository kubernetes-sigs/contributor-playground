# Hi, I’m Toby — DevOps Engineer, Exam Author, and Technical Consultant 🚀

I'm about reliable platforms, automating delivery, and help institutions run fair, defensible exams.

## What I do 🧰
- **DevOps & Platforms:** Windows and Linux at depth; containers, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift; CI/CD architecture and hardening.
- **Automation:** Terraform, Ansible, Bash, PowerShell, Python to remove toil and make delivery repeatable.
- **Identity & Security:** IAM with OIDC/OAuth2 and KeyCloak, from auth flows to token introspection and policy controls 🔐.
- **Architecture & Documentation:** C4, IEEE 42010, ArchiMate, and UML for crisp system views teams can actually use.
- **Professional Education & Public Sector:** Consulting for cantons, schools, vocational training centers and similar institutions; authoring, conducting, and correcting exams.

## How I work ⚙️
- **Requirements first:** Problem, constraints, and success criteria before tools.
- **Solution-agnostic and trade-off focused:** I make decisions explicit.
- **Deterministic:** Clear acceptance criteria beat vague aspirations.
- **Challenger mindset:** I pressure-test assumptions so choices stand in production and audits.

## Toolkit and focus areas 🧪
- **Infra & delivery:** Terraform, Git workflows, artifact management, release strategies.
- **Security-minded ops:** Secrets handling, least privilege, supply-chain hygiene.
- **Observability:** Metrics, logs, and traces that drive action instead of dashboard theater.

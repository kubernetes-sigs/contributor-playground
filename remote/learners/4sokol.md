## Introduction

Hi everyone 👋

My name is Vladimir Sokolenko [4sokol] and I’m currently working at Red Hat as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer.  
I have hands-on experience with Kubernetes, OpenShift and container platforms, including day-to-day operations, reliability, and troubleshooting in production environments.

I’m here to learn, contribute, and gradually get involved in Kubernetes release-related activities.  
Looking forward to collaborating and learning from the community.

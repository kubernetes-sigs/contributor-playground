# I Swallowed a Moon Made of Iron

I swallowed a moon made of iron

They call it Screw

I swallowed the industrial effluent, orders of unemployment

The youths lower than machines have untimely died young

I swallowed the toil, swallowed the displacement,

Swallowed the overpasses, swallowed the life full of limescale

I can’t swallow any more

All I’ve swallowed down are surging out of my throat,

Spreading out across the territory of my country and becoming a

Poem of shame

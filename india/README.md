# Kubernetes Contributor Playground for India

Hi new contributors!

This repository will be used as a safe space for participants in the New Contributor Onboarding Track to familiarize themselves with (some of) the Kubernetes Project's review and pull request processes.

Each subfolder under `india/` contains assets for kubernetes upstream training held in events at India.

Please refer docs in each subfolder for community, discussion, contribution, support, and code of conduct.
